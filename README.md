# GeneticAlgorithmAPI
GA API to solve the problem of finding the decryption key of a cipher text

Developed a Genetic Algorithm API to solve the problem of finding the decryption key of a cipher text for my OOP class. Implemented advanced topics in Java, such as  abstract classes, interfaces, generic classes, methods and containers, and exception handling.

The API is made up of abstract classes and interfaces that allow the programmer to implement their own techniques of representation, selection, crossover and mutation.
It includes the following implementations: 
Individual with character array genotype and  phenotype. 
Selection by tournament.
Crossover with crossover point.
Mutation by swap.
An objective function of frequency analysis.
